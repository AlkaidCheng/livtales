# Permissions

Revision history uses current View permission, including content saved before a
collaborator was invited. It never uses saved permissions. History reads authorize
and fetch within one consistent database snapshot; revoked access applies to
subsequent requests. Deleted resources remain unavailable through normal history
endpoints. See [Object revisions](revisions.md) for disclosure and redaction rules.

Comparisons and previews require current View. Content restore requires current
Edit and the expected version, and never replays grants, scopes, or lifecycle
state. Canonical creation and updates, context and relationship creation,
restoration, recovery, and permission mutations acquire the same workspace
transaction lock before their final authorization decision. A revocation or
scope change that wins the lock is observed by waiting mutations. Version
checks remain necessary for drafts read before acquiring the lock.
Administrative SQL and future membership writers must follow this protocol.

Authorization is an application-layer service with one operation:

```text
can(principal, action, resource)
```

Authentication establishes identity. It does not decide what that identity can
access. Human requests and future share-link or AI tool calls use the same
authorization service.

## Consistent reads

`withReadAuthorization` binds policy checks and database retrieval to one
repeatable-read, read-only transaction. Object detail and access actions, Event
lists and projections, relation and attachment traversal, search, grant lists,
history, restoration previews, Trash, command state, and inventory reference
queries use this boundary.
Nested readers share the same transaction and evaluator, including all members
of a projection. Repeated role lookups for the same principal and canonical
object reuse that snapshot's result. The cache ends with the read transaction;
no permission decision is cached across requests or protected writes.

Grant expiry is evaluated at a fixed application-clock instant for each read
boundary. A read already authorized in its snapshot may finish after revocation,
scope changes, deletion, or expiry. It can return only the state visible in that
snapshot, not subsequent private edits or newly added grant recipients. A later
read evaluates the current policy. This does not retract bytes already sent or
promise one snapshot across separate HTTP requests.

Identity resolution and workspace listing each use their own read boundary.
The selected workspace is still context, not authority: protected resource
services check access again in their own transaction. A session response may
therefore contain an earlier authorized active workspace while a newer workspace
list omits it. That earlier workspace metadata is never refreshed after its
authorization boundary has closed.

These reads do not take the workspace mutation lock or span storage/network I/O.
They hold a database connection until the callback completes. Keep callbacks
short; snapshot isolation does not bound query count, collection size, or pool
wait time. Protected writes continue to use `withStableAuthorization` and version
checks, not read-only snapshots.

## Initial roles

Execute, Undo, and Redo require current Edit on every command member under the
workspace authorization fence. Stack state is scoped by authenticated user and
workspace; heads without current Edit are omitted. Idempotent receipt replay
requires current View on every affected object and never returns saved content.
No inverse replays permissions or security metadata. See [Commands](commands.md).

- Owner can view, comment, edit, share, soft-delete, and recover a resource.
- Editor can view, comment, and edit a resource.
- Viewer can view a resource.

The implemented policy accepts the strongest applicable role from workspace
membership, a direct resource grant, or a grant on the resource's canonical
permission scope. Expired grants do not apply. Normal access excludes grants
targeting deleted objects; the explicit Owner-only recovery policy resolves
tombstones without enabling normal reads. It does not support explicit deny
precedence or field-level grants. See [Recovery](recovery.md).

Owner and Editor workspace members can create self-scoped objects. Creating an
inheriting object requires Edit on the selected permission scope. Viewer access
never permits creation or mutation.

The persistence kernel stores exactly one `permission_scope_id` per canonical
object. Its composite foreign key requires the scope and resource to share a
workspace. A self-scope stops inheritance. Direct V1 grants target users who
may be outside the resource workspace so an owner can share one Event without
granting workspace membership. The grant's resource must still belong to its
declared workspace, which prevents a forged cross-workspace resource link.

Resource owners can create, list, and revoke direct grants through the same
authorization boundary. The browser offers Owner and Viewer; the API also
accepts Editor. A development recipient is resolved by normalized email and
must have signed in once so a canonical user exists. Revocation removes the
active grant row and records an immutable `resource.share_revoked` audit event,
so access disappears on the next request while the administrative history
remains available in the audit log.

Object references never grant access. APIs, projections, searches, attachment
URLs, and relation traversal must independently authorize every protected
resource they return. One exception is deliberate: a Task names its
assignee. `GET /events/:id/assignees` returns the display name and nickname
of the Person each Task the viewer may view is assigned to, even where the
viewer may not open that Person (a guest of an Event reading a card of the
owner's space); nothing else of the Person is returned, and the Person
itself stays unavailable. In the same way `POST /events/:id/assignees/me`
names to the caller the Person linked to the caller's own account in the
Event's workspace, which a guest may not open either.

Document upload authorization requires Edit on the Event, Task, or Expense
being attached to. The resulting Document inherits that parent's canonical
permission scope. Finalization rechecks Edit so a revoked user cannot turn an
earlier upload into a canonical object. Listing attachments requires View on
the parent and separately authorizes every Document; inaccessible attachments
contribute only to a generic count.

Download authorization requires View on the canonical Document. Local
downloads use an opaque, expiring, one-time bearer credential and recheck View
when bytes are requested, so revoking a grant invalidates an already-issued
download. Viewers can download inherited files but cannot upload, replace, or
unlink them. No permanent public URLs are returned. Direct COS URLs contain
opaque storage keys and remain bearer capabilities until expiry, even after
an application grant is revoked. Every new URL request rechecks current View;
COS enforces the already-issued capability, not the application's current grant.
See [Storage](storage.md) for deployment and audit requirements.

Storage I/O runs outside the workspace lock. Upload/download authorization
records are written only after permission is rechecked under that lock.
Finalization rechecks Edit and reads the parent's current permission scope
before creating the Document. Local download consumption rechecks View and
expiry after reading the file, before committing the consumption and its
audit event. Revocation that commits during storage I/O prevents completion.
A download already authorized and consumed may finish sending its bytes;
revocation does not retract a response already in progress.

The lock is per workspace, so unrelated workspaces can still write concurrently.
Within one workspace, protected mutations serialize. This deliberately favors
correct ordering; measure contention before introducing finer-grained locks.
Remote signed transfers retain their storage provider's expiry/revocation
semantics and require separate adapter validation.

The [storage inventory](storage-reconciliation.md) requires Owner workspace
membership through `AuthorizationService.assertWorkspaceOwner`. A resource Owner
grant does not confer this authority. Ownership is checked before starting,
inside the read-only reference snapshot, inside the lookup of other workspaces'
records, and after storage I/O. Only aggregate counts are returned, including
canonical trash and history references; no object identities or file keys are
disclosed. A report counts the files its own workspace's records name and the
unnamed files under its own prefix; the lookup that leaves out files another
workspace's records name accepts only keys under the caller's own prefix, so
nothing about another workspace's files enters the report.

The Event collection is also a protected query. It selects candidates only in
the active workspace and applies the canonical View decision to every returned
Event. A relationship or workspace ID alone cannot make an Event appear.

Search follows the same rule. It selects only active candidates from the
authenticated workspace, applies their View permissions before LIMIT,
and returns no total computed from unauthorized rows. Object-type filters do
not weaken that decision. A directly shared Event and its inheriting children
can appear; a related self-scoped object cannot.

Creating a relationship requires Edit on its source and View on its target.
Listing relationships first authorizes the requested object, then omits links
whose other endpoint is unavailable to the caller. Removing a relationship
requires Edit on its source and leaves both objects intact.

`permission_scope_id = id` stops inheritance. Any other value selects exactly
one object in the same workspace as the inheritance source. Relation rows are
never consulted when evaluating access.

### Batch evaluation

`can()` and `canMany()` share the same policy implementation. `canMany()` returns
one boolean per input reference, in the same order, including duplicate,
missing, and cross-workspace references. `allowedActionsMany()` returns the
corresponding capability arrays; deleted objects have no normal capabilities.
Recovery uses the existing tombstone-aware Owner predicate, including grants on
a deleted scope. It is not interchangeable with normal View access.

```ts
await withReadAuthorization(database, async (transaction, authorization) => {
  const visible = await authorization.canMany(principal, "view", resources);
  const actions = await authorization.allowedActionsMany(principal, resources);
  // Retrieve visible content using transaction within this callback.
});
```

The store joins workspace membership, direct grants, and active canonical
scope grants for at most 1,000 distinct same-workspace IDs per statement. Larger inputs
use sequential chunks on the owning transaction. No permission decision survives
that operation, and a failed chunk rejects the entire read. An empty or entirely
cross-workspace input needs no policy query. Scope inheritance remains one hop;
neither relation traversal nor recursive grant inheritance is introduced.

Detail projections and attachments use these
batch decisions. Removed-link lists evaluate both endpoint capabilities per
candidate chunk and may visit multiple candidate pages. Batching does not
bound their total response size or scan work.

Search and the Event collection use the evaluator's
`resourcePredicate(principal, "view")` in SQL before ordering and limiting
results. This predicate targets
the canonical `objects` table, includes workspace and active-object checks,
and uses scalar forms of the same role queries and action rules as `can()` and
`canMany()`. Batch reads join those queries so PostgreSQL can reuse shared scopes.
It must be used inside the same read boundary as the selected content. Its
Recover action retains the separate tombstone policy. Search cursors carry
positions, not grants: every page evaluates current access in a fresh read
snapshot, and a changed or forged position cannot reveal inaccessible rows.

Event pages select authorized IDs and hydrate their typed state in the same
snapshot. The cursor's `asOf` fixes only the past/upcoming classification;
grant expiration always uses the current read's independent authorization
clock. Collection filtering and pagination never grant access or expose private
totals. A cursor remains usable after its boundary is deleted, but only returns
currently visible active records.

Active relation pages authorize the starting object and use the same SQL View
predicate for the opposite endpoint before limiting links. Incoming sources
are protected exactly like outgoing targets. All checks share the metadata
snapshot and evaluation clock. Relation filters and cursor positions never
grant access, and neither hidden metadata nor hidden-link counts are returned.
Each continuation rechecks current permissions, including expiry and stopped
inheritance; a deleted or revoked starting object cannot be read using a cursor.

See [Authorization performance](authorization-performance.md) for measured
query counts, latency, and the workload limitations.

Changing a permission scope is an Owner operation and uses the object's
optimistic version. V1 permits an object to become self-scoped or to inherit
from a self-scoped Event in the same workspace. Event detail omits inaccessible
related resources and returns only a generic locked-relation count; object
identities, types, and business fields are not exposed.

The active workspace is request context, not a grant. A user can select a
workspace only through membership or an active grant to a non-deleted resource,
or an active Owner grant to a tombstone for recovery. Resource authorization additionally requires the resource workspace
to match that active workspace. Missing and unauthorized resources use the same
external error shape so forged IDs do not reveal existence.

### Deleting a space

Only an Owner deletes a shared workspace, and only while it holds nothing but
Trash: no record that is out of Trash with its permission scope out of Trash
too. A personal workspace is never deleted, which a check constraint also
holds. The deletion takes the workspace's lock as membership changes do,
checks the rule again under it, and removes everything that admits a user:
waiting shares are revoked, the live grants on its records are revoked with a
`resource.share_revoked` audit event each, and every membership is removed.
The workspace row stays, marked with `deleted_at` and `deleted_by`, and session
resolution and the list of available workspaces leave it out on both backends
even if an admitting row were to reappear, so a session that names it is
`workspace_unavailable`. A trigger refuses a record inserted into a deleted
workspace or restored from its Trash; it takes the workspace row in share
mode, so a create or restore that overlaps a deletion in progress waits for
it and is then refused, and one that commits first makes the deletion see a
live record and refuse. The records, their revisions, the audit trail, and the
stored files are kept: deletion is a mark, not a purge.

The [private container stack](deployment.md#database-privilege-boundary) uses a
separate runtime login with explicit table privileges; owner credentials stay
with migrations and provisioning. Audit/history tables are read/insert only,
and runtime cannot alter schema, disable triggers, or permanently delete objects.
The host development defaults still use the owner account.

PostgreSQL row-level security remains deferred defense in depth. Protected
queries do not yet consistently bind a transaction-local workspace setting;
session state could leak between pooled requests. Runtime table privileges are
not per-user or per-workspace authorization. Fine-grained authorization remains
in the application layer so its decisions are consistent across clients.

Event page layouts use View/Edit on the owning Event through the same policy
evaluator. A component is not a grant to its projected records: each projection
continues to authorize its canonical objects. Layout saves use stable workspace
authorization, an expected layout version, and an atomic audit/history write.
View includes saved layout revisions, including snapshots created before the
grant. Each history page rechecks current access; revocation and Event soft
deletion deny subsequent reads and restores. Restoration requires Edit and
does not change permissions or access to any projected record.
