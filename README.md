# LivTales

LivTales is a life-journey platform for connecting the people, places, plans,
events, travel, finances, documents, collections, and memories that make up a
person's life.

LivTales is both the product and the codebase: the repository, the
`@livtales/*` packages, and the code carry the name, and
[`brand/`](brand/README.md) holds the brand sources and their usage rules. The
database objects, the keys browsers and Mini Programs already store, and the
CloudBase services keep the earlier name Chronelle on purpose;
[Names that keep Chronelle](docs/architecture.md#names-that-keep-chronelle)
lists them.

This repository contains a runnable Next.js web surface, a Fastify API,
provider-independent identity, centralized object authorization, shared
runtime-validated schemas, and the canonical PostgreSQL persistence kernel for
the event-planning vertical slice.

The implemented architecture is documented in
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

The API supports [reversible Event/Task content commands](docs/commands.md),
including atomic edits and conflict-safe Undo/Redo. Web command controls and
reversible trash/link actions are not yet implemented.

## Stack

For offline UI review without a server, database, or cloud account, run
`pnpm sandbox` and open `.livtales/sandbox/livtales.html` directly. See the
[browser-only design sandbox guide](docs/browser-sandbox.md) for setup, supported
interactions, persistence limits, and testing. Use fictional data only.

- Next.js, React, and strict TypeScript for the responsive web client
- Taro 4 and React 18 for the native WeChat Mini Program client
- TanStack Query and TanStack Table for server state and planning tables
- Fastify and Zod for the typed REST API boundary
- PostgreSQL with immutable SQL migrations and Drizzle query mappings
- PostgreSQL full-text search with authorization before cursor pagination
- Bounded Event pages with server-side name/period filters and stable sorting
- Provider-neutral private storage with local filesystem and Tencent COS adapters
- pnpm workspaces in a modular monorepo
- Vitest, Playwright, Biome, Prettier, and container builds in CI

Web and Mini Program presentation components remain platform-specific. They
share runtime contracts and, as the Mini Program becomes connected, the same
typed REST API and canonical authorization boundary.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 or newer, below Node.js 27
- pnpm 11.25
- Docker with Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL `psql` client 17 for the database privilege tests
- WeChat DevTools for Mini Program preview and physical-device testing

## Environment

Copy the development defaults before starting services:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The checked-in values are local-only defaults. Production credentials must be
provided through managed secret storage.

`ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_AUTH=true` enables the development sign-in, which asserts
an identity from a submitted email without a password. Every sign-in records
a session that survives API restarts until it expires or is revoked. Keep it
off in a deployment. `ENABLE_WECHAT_AUTH=true` instead enables server-verified
CloudBase WeChat exchange and explicit linking to an existing account after
migration 0071 has been applied; the Mini Program stores only the resulting
opaque LivTales session token.

## Install and run

Install dependencies once:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then use the three-command development workflow to start PostgreSQL, apply any
pending migrations, and run both apps:

```bash
docker compose up -d
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev
```

In a checkout from before the LivTales rename, carry the local database over to
the renamed Compose project once, as
[local development](docs/local-development.md#services) describes, before
`docker compose up -d`: otherwise the old container keeps the port, or Compose
starts with an empty volume.

The web app listens on <http://localhost:3000>. The API health endpoint is
available at <http://localhost:4000/api/health>.

Build or watch the Mini Program separately, then open `apps/wechat` in WeChat
DevTools. The checked-in project uses the non-secret `touristappid`; keep a
real AppID in `apps/wechat/project.private.config.json`, which is ignored:

```bash
TARO_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com \
TARO_APP_CLOUDBASE_ENV_ID=your-cloudbase-environment-id \
pnpm build:weapp
pnpm wechat:bundle
```

The native shell restores and revokes LivTales sessions, links an existing
account explicitly, switches workspaces, pages through canonical Events, and
shows an authorized Event overview. Owners and editors can create or edit
undated, date-only, timed, and multi-day Events with native pickers. Version
conflicts never overwrite silently, and bounded local drafts retain a stable
creation command for safe retries. App visibility and network changes drive the
same TanStack Query focus and online semantics used by the web client. CloudBase
credentials remain transient; local storage retains only the opaque LivTales
session. Lazy feature subpackages provide the Event editor and a layout-driven
planning workspace whose pages render authorized canonical To-do, Calendar,
Timeline, Itinerary, Expense, and Reminder projections. Removing a planning
component changes only the Event layout, never the underlying object. Owners
and editors can create, edit, schedule, assign to an existing section, and
complete the same canonical Tasks shown by those projections; version conflicts
retain the local draft for an explicit recovery choice. The To-dos component
supports list, by-day, week, board, and month views, plus section creation,
editing, ordering, and removal. See
[WeChat Mini Program](docs/wechat.md).

Open <http://localhost:3000/sign-in> to create a development session, then use
the Events workspace to build an event plan. The web server forwards `/api`
requests to `API_INTERNAL_URL`, which defaults to the local API.

Stop local infrastructure without deleting its named database volume:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Database migrations

Add immutable, ordered SQL files to `infrastructure/migrations` using the
`NNNN_description.sql` convention. Apply all pending migrations with:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

The runner records each filename and SHA-256 checksum. It refuses to continue
if an already-applied migration has changed.

For an existing database, stop all API writers and run `pnpm db:baseline-revisions`
after migration and before restart. The command captures the available state of
existing live and deleted objects without inventing earlier history. Startup
checks that every current object version has a snapshot. See
[Object revisions](docs/revisions.md) for the deployment barrier and history API.

History actions provide paginated versions, typed comparisons, and confirmed
content restoration. Restoring advances the canonical version while preserving
current permissions and immutable financial/file facts. See the
[restore policy](docs/revisions.md#content-restoration) before deploying the
restoration migration; API and web must be upgraded together.

Workspace Trash provides Owner-authorized deleted-object previews and recovery.
Event Actions distinguish unlinking a context from deleting a canonical object;
Removed links restores independently removed relationships. Migration 0008 adds
relation versions and requires API/web deployment together with old writers
stopped. See [Trash and recovery](docs/recovery.md) for the new versioned relation
contract and recovery guarantees.

The first migration creates the common object layer plus typed `Event`, `Task`,
`Expense`, `Reminder`, and `Document` tables. SQL owns database constraints;
Drizzle maps the accepted schema for typed application queries.

The second migration adds the unique personal-workspace owner link and an
index for principal-side grant lookup.

The third migration adds durable, expiring document-transfer authorizations.
Only credential hashes are persisted; file bytes remain outside PostgreSQL.

The fourth migration adds a partial PostgreSQL full-text index for active
canonical object names.

## Development authentication

Create a development session and personal workspace:

```bash
curl --request POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/development/sign-in \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"displayName":"Alex Example","email":"alex@example.com"}'
```

Use the returned token to resolve the current session:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/auth/session \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer <access-token>'
```

Pass `x-workspace-id` to select another workspace. Selection succeeds only for
a workspace where the user has membership or an active resource grant.

Migration 0071 normalizes external providers in `user_identities`, preserving
existing user IDs and personal workspaces. With `ENABLE_WECHAT_AUTH=true`,
`POST /api/auth/wechat` consumes a verified CloudBase WeChat proof once and
returns the same opaque LivTales session shape. An authenticated user can add
that provider through `POST /api/auth/wechat/link`; LivTales never merges
accounts from names or unverified email addresses.

## Event-planning API

The API can create, read, update, and soft-delete canonical Events, Tasks,
Expenses, and Reminders. First-class relationship endpoints compose them into
an event plan. Event detail, to-do, calendar, timeline, itinerary, expense, and
reminder endpoints are authorized read-time projections over those same object
IDs. See [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md) for routes and examples.

Owners can share a root Event directly with an existing LivTales user as
Owner, Editor, or Viewer. Child resources inherit through the Event's canonical
permission scope, not through their relationship. A versioned scope change can
make one child private while leaving both the object and relationship intact.

## Event-planning workspace

Events open on [user-composed pages](docs/event-pages.md). Add a named page and
insert Tasks, Calendar, Timeline, Expenses, Reminders, Files, and People
through a focused picker. Layouts save independently from canonical objects;
the same records stay synchronized across pages. Browse
event data opens the other planning views. Migration 0011 and refreshed runtime
role grants are required before deploying the page-layout API.

The web client provides development sign-in, an event list, event editing,
tasks, calendar (as a list, an agenda, a week, or a month), timeline,
expenses, and reminders. Creating a schedule item creates one canonical Event.
Its ID is preserved in the calendar and timeline projections, and an edit
invalidates every affected view. Optimistic-concurrency conflicts show a refresh action instead of
silently overwriting newer data. The Sharing view manages Owner and Viewer
access, lists inheriting resources, and can stop inheritance. A workspace
selector exposes workspaces reached through active grants; Viewer panels remain
read-only and inaccessible references render without protected details.

The Files view attaches private files to Events, Tasks, and Expenses. Uploads
and downloads use short-lived transfer authorizations. Finalization
creates one canonical Document and an `attached_to` relationship; unlinking
removes only that relationship. Local files live below `LOCAL_STORAGE_ROOT`
with restrictive permissions and one-time API transfer endpoints. The optional
Tencent COS adapter uses direct signed URLs, reusable until expiry, without
changing canonical document behavior. Neither adapter creates permanent public
URLs. See [Storage](docs/storage.md) for configuration and validation requirements.

Workspace owners can request a [read-only storage inventory](docs/storage-reconciliation.md)
that counts canonical/history references, pending uploads, and unreferenced files.
It retains every file and returns no storage keys or cleanup instructions.

Administrators with PostgreSQL access can inspect aggregate table, index, and
optional revision sizes with `pnpm db:footprint`; see
[Database storage](docs/database-storage.md) for costs and interpretation.

The Search view queries canonical object names with an optional object-type
filter. Results are restricted to the active workspace and independently
authorized before the API returns them. Search stores no projection copy and
does not expose a count of protected matches.

## Development commands

Run API and web development servers:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Run the complete local quality gate:

```bash
pnpm check
```

The database tests create and drop disposable PostgreSQL databases. Start the
Compose service first and provide `TEST_DATABASE_URL` when not using the local
defaults.

`pnpm check` builds the workspace packages once, then type-checks and tests
every package in parallel (four at a time) before building the API, web, and
WeChat applications. The WeChat build also enforces its package-size budgets.
Individual checks are available as `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm lint`,
`pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build`; the `typecheck` and `test`
scripts of each package rebuild their upstream packages first, and their
`typecheck:unit` and `test:unit` forms assume that build has happened.

Install the pinned browser builds once, then run the real-browser release gate
against the PostgreSQL service:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install chromium webkit
pnpm test:e2e
```

The browser gate runs the same canonical Event creation and search path at
desktop and narrow-mobile widths. It also checks tab-keyboard behavior, the
skip link, and horizontal overflow. Targeted desktop/mobile WebKit cases cover
Event scheduling, date formatting, and creation-dialog focus. CI uses the pinned
Playwright image and runs one browser project per runner with two workers
(`E2E_PROJECT=name` selects one project locally too); a WebKit journey costs
almost twice a Chromium one, so slicing by project keeps the runners even. The
offline sandbox suite runs in a separate concurrent job with four workers. The
required `browser` check succeeds only when every project and the sandbox suite
pass. Local
browser runs use one worker; pass `--workers=4` to Playwright to exercise
concurrent execution locally.
Engine emulation does not replace manual screen-reader or physical-device testing.

The API suite contains a fresh-database release test for the complete event
slice. It covers canonical projections, Owner and Viewer behavior, hidden
relations, search isolation, version conflicts, soft deletion, private
attachments across an API restart, and audit request IDs.

## Known V1A limitations

- Development authentication is in-memory and is not a production identity
  provider.
- Search covers canonical display names and one object-type filter with
  visibility-aware cursor pagination. Events also use cursor pages with name
  and period filters. Richer search filters and pagination for relation and
  recovery collections remain deferred.
- PostgreSQL RLS is deferred until the runtime uses a separate least-privilege
  database role and transaction-local workspace context. Application
  authorization and workspace constraints remain mandatory.
- Tencent COS has a signed-transfer adapter and simulated integration tests;
  live bucket/IAM/CORS validation and production storage operations are pending.
- Reminder delivery providers, invitations, anonymous links, and the travel
  object slice remain deferred. Task recurrence is a rule on the task whose
  completion advances the due (ADR 0047); reminders do not repeat yet.

## Containers and delivery

The web experience includes responsive event collections, grid/list layouts,
date and name filters, bookmarkable planning views, and mobile account controls.
See [Web experience](docs/web-experience.md) for behavior and accessibility, and
[Deployment](docs/deployment.md) for exact standalone/container commands.
The UI is deployable for trusted previews; unverified development sign-in blocks
public production launch.

Build either application from the repository root:

```bash
docker build -f apps/api/Dockerfile -t livtales-api:local .
docker build -f apps/web/Dockerfile -t livtales-web:local .
```

CI runs quality checks, application browser tests, offline sandbox tests, and
container validation concurrently. These cover formatting, lint, types, tests,
application builds, responsive browser behavior, and running containers with a
disposable private database. Version tags and manual releases run these same gates
before publishing the tested images to GitHub Container Registry. Full commit SHA
tags identify the validated source; publication does not rebuild images. A runtime
deployment target is intentionally not selected yet.

Repository policy requires pull-request review and passing `quality`, `browser`,
and `containers` checks for `main`. When host-side branch rules are unavailable,
maintainers enforce the same policy through the review workflow.
